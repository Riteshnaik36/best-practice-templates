A Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure multiple services, networks, and volumes required for your application to run.

Best Practices:

Version Control: Store your docker-compose.yml file in version control alongside your application code.
Use .env for Environment Variables: Store environment-specific settings in .env files and refer to them in your docker-compose.yml.

sample Code:::
================================================================================================================================================================================
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: webapp:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG_MODE}
================================================================================================================================================================================
Keep services isolated: Define different containers for different services (e.g., database, application, etc.).
Use Named Volumes: Use volumes for persistent data (e.g., database data), ensuring data is not lost when containers are stopped or recreated.
Use depends_on: Ensure that dependencies are started in the correct order, though consider using health checks for more reliability.
